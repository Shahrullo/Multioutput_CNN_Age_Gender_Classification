# Multioutput CNN Based Age Gender Classification

The side project for multioutput Convolutional Neural Networks based Age and Gender prediction model. The model is conducted on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to classify both age ang gender. I made a model project with custom CNN that I introduced. The model is trained on [Adience unfiltered benchmark] (https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html). 

## Prerequisites

Thinks you have to install or installed on your working machine:

- Python
- Numpy 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Torchvision 
- PyTorch 

You can install the required packages by executing the following command.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Environment
 - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Jupyter Notebook

`Multioutput_CNN_Based_ Age_Gender_Classification.ipynb`

The jupyter notebook describes the whole project. You can find the whole description inside the notebook.

### How to use it 
Open `Multioutput_CNN_Based_ Age_Gender_Classification.ipynb` on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab and run it.
